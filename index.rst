Say It With Bots!
=================

Welcoming Contributions to Your Project
---------------------------------------

In this workshop we'll be building a GitHub bot that will greet contributors
to your project. The bot will be built as a GitHub App which can then be
installed to your GitHub repositories.

We will be building a GitHub bot that can:

- say thanks to the maintainer who installed your bot

- say thanks to new contributors who made pull requests to your repository

About me
--------

My name is Mariatta. I live in Vancouver, Canada where I work as a Software Engineer
for Zapier. In my free time, I help organize Vancouver PyLadies, PyCascades conference,
and contribute to open source.

I'm a Python Core Developer. I help maintain Core Python's GitHub bots:
`bedevere <https://github.com/python/bedevere>`_ and
`miss-islington <https://github.com/miss-islington>`_.

We'll be using the same tools and technologies used by Core Python's
team to build their bots.
